Overview
---
Lane detection is one of the most important aspect in self driving car. In this project, lanes are detected from a test video given using openCV tools. Canny edge detection and hough transform are used to detect lines which is used to interpolate lane lines in the image.   

P1.ipynb is the source code file for the project.
WhiteRight.mp4, YellowLeft.mp4 and op_challenge.mp4 are the output files for the test videos with detected lane lines.
